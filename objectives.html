  <h1> Prescribed Burning in the Rice Lake Plains </h1>
  <h1> OBJECTIVES </h1>
  <h7> The Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) prescribed burn parcels within the Rice Lake Plains boudary. They requested help with establishing technological and cartographic solutions for their data. These solutions were to include:</h7>
    <ol class="a">
      <li> A database that would enable them to systematically identify parcels for future burns using a defined year gap in burning as its basis and that was updatable with each new year’s burns; </li>
      <li> An interactive map that filtered by year to show which burns had been conducted during each year since computer records have been kept since 2007, and that was updatable with each year’s burns. This map is to be used internally, and with parcel data from the MNRF generalized housed on the NCC of Rice Lake Plains website;</li>
      <li> A series of static maps that showed the burns for each year in each parcel that could be handed out to the general public, funders and possible funders to show the work they have done and that was updateable with each year’s burns; </li>
      <li> A manual that detailed how to manage and update the above deliverables, including workflows.</li>
    </ol>
